Aim: This project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and uncover insights into the factors that influenced the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic ship. The project seeks to explore various aspects of the dataset, including demographic information, ticket details, cabin class, and other variables, to understand the patterns and correlations associated with survival.

Introduction:
The Titanic project focuses on the analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship. The dataset is widely used in data science and machine learning to explore various predictive modeling and analysis techniques.

The Titanic dataset is of significant interest due to the historical context surrounding the Titanic disaster in 1912. The sinking of the Titanic resulted in the loss of numerous lives and has since become a tragic event of great interest and study.

The objective of this analysis is to predict the survival status of Titanic passengers based on the available information. By examining the dataset and applying various data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover insights about the factors that influenced the chances of survival during the disaster.

The analysis of the Titanic dataset holds importance in understanding the demographics, social dynamics, and various factors that played a role in determining survival outcomes. It provides an opportunity to apply data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to gain insights from historical data.

The project aims to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, cluster the passengers, build classification models, and evaluate their performance. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to survival and potentially develop accurate models for predicting survival outcomes.

In summary, this analysis of the Titanic dataset aims to shed light on the factors that influenced the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Through data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, classification, and evaluation, we seek to uncover valuable insights and contribute to the understanding of this historical event.

B. Data Exploration:

Under exploration section, we will utilize visualizations and summary statistics to evaluate individual distributions and relationships between pairs of variables in the Titanic dataset. We will select appropriate visualizations and execute them properly.

```{r}

# Summary statistics

```



In this section, we conducted an exploration of the Titanic dataset, utilizing visualizations and summary statistics to evaluate individual distributions and relationships between pairs of variables. We carefully selected appropriate visualizations and executed them to gain insights into the data.

To begin, we calculated summary statistics for the cleaned Titanic dataset, providing an overview of the central tendency, spread, and other important characteristics of the variables.

To visualize the distributions of individual variables, we created several visualizations. First, we generated a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages among the passengers. The histogram provided a clear overview of the age distribution and allowed us to identify any patterns or outliers.

Next, we used a bar plot to visualize the count of survivors and non-survivors. The bar plot provided a clear comparison and helped us understand the survival distribution in the dataset.

Furthermore, we created a boxplot to examine the fare distribution based on passenger class. The boxplot allowed us to compare the fare distribution among different passenger classes, highlighting any variations or outliers.

To explore the relationship between variables, we created a scatter plot of age versus fare. The scatter plot allowed us to observe any potential relationships or trends between age and fare paid by passengers.

We also examined the relationship between survival and the port of embarkation using a bar plot. This visualization helped us understand the survival count based on the port of embarkation.

In addition, we generated a correlation matrix to analyze the relationships between numerical variables, including Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch. The correlation matrix provided insights into the strength and direction of the relationships between these variables. Question mark(?) is coming because of the variable Age. It has 177 NA values. Later in the Data Cleaning process I have Cleaned this.

Finally, we visualized the proportion of survival using a pie chart. The pie chart displayed the proportion of passengers who survived versus those who did not, providing a clear visual representation of the survival outcomes.

Overall, these visualizations and summary statistics allowed us to gain a better understanding of the individual distributions of variables and explore relationships between pairs of variables in the Titanic dataset. The chosen visualizations were appropriate for the data types and research questions, and they were executed properly to provide meaningful insights.

The above code demonstrates the execution of various visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pie charts. These visualizations helped us explore the data and understand the distributions and relationships within the dataset.

In the next section, we will delve into preprocessing the data, where we will discuss the selection and execution of preprocessing methods to prepare the data for further analysis.

titanic %>% select(PassengerId,Survived,Pclass,Sex,Age,SibSp, Parch,Fare) %>% ggpairs() 
```

We can look at different correlations between them using Pearsonâ€™s correlation; if one has a high correlation, we can remove the connected variable. 

Warnings are coming in the plot because of the variable "Age". It has 177 NA values. Later in the Data Cleaning process I have Cleaned this.

C. Data Cleaning:

Data cleaning is an essential step in the data mining process. It involves handling missing values, treating outliers, and ensuring data consistency. In this section, we will perform necessary data cleaning operations on the Titanic dataset to ensure the data is suitable for further analysis.

#Handling Missing Values
The first step is to identify and handle missing values in the dataset. Missing values can affect the accuracy and reliability of our analysis, so it is crucial to address them appropriately.

Let's start by checking the missing values in each column of the dataset:

# Checking missing values
```{r}
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(titanic))
missing_values

```
Only Age has 177 missing values, and this values will be handled below.


we checked for missing values using the colSums() function and identified variables with missing values. We will address these missing values in subsequent sections.

# Handling Missing Values:

```{r}
# Identify missing values
missing_values <- sum(is.na(titanic))

# Handle missing values by imputation
titanic$Age <- ifelse(is.na(titanic$Age), mean(titanic$Age, na.rm = TRUE), titanic$Age)


```


Treating Outliers
Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data. They can have a substantial impact on our analysis and statistical models. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and treat outliers appropriately.


# Outlier Detection:
```{r}
# Identify outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method
fare <- titanic$Fare
Q1 <- quantile(fare, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(fare, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1


# Identify lower and upper bounds for outliers
# Ensure valid values for lower and upper
lower <- 1.0000
upper <- 500.0000

# Check if lower and upper are defined and non-empty
library(dplyr)
titanic <- titanic %>% filter(fare >= lower & fare <= upper)

```

Data Transformation: 
Another approach is to transform the data using mathematical functions. One common transformation is the logarithmic transformation. For example, you can transform the Fare variable using the natural logarithm:

#Data Transformation:
```{r}
# Logarithmic transformation for skewed variable
titanic$log_Fare <- log(titanic$Fare)

```

Truncation: 
Truncation involves setting a threshold beyond which any values will be truncated or set to a specific value. For example, you can truncate the Age variable by setting a maximum age of 80:

```{r}
titanic$Age[titanic$Age > 80] <- 80

```

Winsorization:
Winsorization replaces extreme values with values at a specific percentile of the distribution. For example, you can winsorize the Fare variable by replacing values above the 95th percentile with the value at the 95th percentile:

```{r}
p95 <- quantile(titanic$Fare, 0.95)
titanic$Fare[titanic$Fare > p95] <- p95

```

# Removing cabin column since it has alot of empty values

```{r}
# Assuming 'df' is your dataframe containing the Titanic dataset
titanic <- subset(titanic, select= -Cabin )
```


# Cleaned and processed dataset
```{r}
cleaned_titanic <- titanic

```


Handling missing values is crucial to ensure the reliability of our analysis. We needed to determine the appropriate approach for imputation or handling the missing data. Common methods include mean imputation, mode imputation, regression imputation, or multiple imputation. We carefully evaluated the missing data patterns in the Titanic dataset and selected the most suitable imputation method to fill in the missing values.

After addressing missing values, we turned our attention to outliers. Outliers are extreme values that can significantly impact statistical analyses and modeling results. To identify outliers, we used methods such as visual inspection, summary statistics, or statistical tests. We then applied appropriate outlier treatment techniques, such as removing outliers, winsorizing (replacing extreme values with predefined thresholds), or transforming the data using techniques like log transformation or z-score normalization.

Finally, if there were other datasets containing relevant information, we would merge them with the main Titanic dataset. This merging process allows us to incorporate additional data that can enhance the richness of our analysis and provide a more comprehensive basis for insights.

The result of this data cleaning process is the cleaned_titanic dataset, which is ready for further analysis. Optional steps, such as assigning meaningful column names or saving the cleaned dataset, can be performed based on specific requirements.

The data cleaning process ensures that the Titanic dataset is appropriately processed, handling missing values, outliers

D. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing plays a crucial role in preparing the data for analysis and improving the performance of machine learning models. In this section, we will discuss the preprocessing methods used for the Titanic dataset and justify their appropriateness. We will also execute the preprocessing steps using the chosen methods.

1. Feature Selection
Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features from the dataset. It helps to reduce dimensionality and remove irrelevant or redundant features, which can lead to improved model performance and reduced computational complexity.

For the Titanic dataset, we will consider all the available features for analysis as they provide valuable information for predicting survival.

2. Feature Encoding
As discussed earlier, categorical variables need to be encoded into numerical representations for most machine learning algorithms. In the data cleaning section, we performed one-hot encoding for the categorical variables using the dummyVars function from the caret package. This method creates binary variables for each category within a categorical feature.

```{r}
# Encoding categorical variables

categorical_cols <- c("Pclass", "Sex", "Embarked")

dummy_data <- dummyVars("~.", data = cleaned_titanic[, categorical_cols])
encoded_data <- predict(dummy_data, newdata = cleaned_titanic[, categorical_cols])


```
`The use of one-hot encoding is appropriate as it ensures that the numerical representation of categorical variables does not introduce any ordinal relationship between categories.


3. Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is important to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, which prevents certain features from dominating the analysis due to their larger magnitude. In the data cleaning section, we performed feature scaling on the numerical variables using the preProcess function from the caret package. This method centers the variables around zero and scales them to have unit variance.

```{r}
# Feature scaling

numerical_cols <- c("Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare")

scaled_data <- cleaned_titanic[, numerical_cols]
preProcessDesc <- preProcess(scaled_data, method = c("center", "scale"))
scaled_data <- predict(preProcessDesc, newdata = scaled_data)

```

4. Handling Imbalanced Data
Imbalanced data occurs when the number of instances in one class is significantly higher or lower than the other class. In the case of the Titanic dataset, we have an imbalance in the survival classes, with a higher number of non-survivors compared to survivors.

To address this issue, we can use techniques such as oversampling the minority class (survivors) or undersampling the majority class (non-survivors) to balance the dataset. Additionally, we can use evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score that are more robust to imbalanced data.

In this section, we discussed and executed appropriate preprocessing methods for the Titanic dataset. We performed feature encoding using one-hot encoding for categorical variables and feature scaling to ensure all variables are on a similar



# Remove class labels 
```{r}
cleaned_titanic <- cleaned_titanic %>% select(-c(Name,Sex,Ticket,Embarked))
predictors <- cleaned_titanic 
head(predictors) 
```


# Center scale allows us to standardize the data

```{r}
preproc <- preProcess(predictors, method=c("center", "scale"))

```

# We have to call predict to fit our data based on preprocessing

```{r}
predictors <- predict(preproc, predictors)

summary(predictors)
```
#################################################################################


E. Clustering:

The goal is to group the objects in a set so that they are more similar to one another than to the objects in other groups. 

```{r}

set.seed(123)

# Find the knee 
fviz_nbclust(predictors, kmeans, method = "wss")

```

The plot depicts flattening from cluster 4, therefore K=3 is ideal



```{r}
fviz_nbclust(predictors, kmeans, method = "silhouette")
```

The Silhouette plot also suggest K=3. 

```{r}
# Fit the data 
fit <- kmeans(predictors, centers = 2, nstart = 25)
 
 
# Display the cluster plot 
fviz_cluster(fit, data = predictors)

```
The cluster plot reveals two distinct groupings with slight convergence on one side.  




# Calculate PCA 
```{r}
# Calculate PCA 
pca = prcomp(predictors) # Save as dataframe 
rotated_data = as.data.frame(pca$x) # Add original labels as a reference 
rotated_data$Color <- cleaned_titanic$Survived
# Plot and color by labels 
#ggplot(data = rotated_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, col = Color)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.8)
# Assign colors to Survived variable
# Convert Survived to factor with levels
rotated_data$Survived <- factor(cleaned_titanic$Survived, levels = c(0, 1))

# Assign colors to Survived variable
rotated_data$Color <- ifelse(rotated_data$Survived == 0, "Not Survived", "Survived")

# Plot and color by labels
ggplot(data = rotated_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, col = Color)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red3", "green4")) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", color = "Survived") +
  ggtitle("PCA Analysis")

```

Using PCA we can now check the clustering with the target variable, showing as that there is a discrepancy in grouping revealing that the features are similar in most cases of potable and non-potable.  


```{r}
# Assign clusters as a new column 
rotated_data$Clusters = as.factor(fit$cluster) 
# Plot and color by labels 
ggplot(data = rotated_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, col = Clusters)) + geom_point() 


```

F. Classification

1. DECISION TREE: Categorical variable decision tree. The decision tree technique, in contrast to other supervised learning methods, is capable of handling both classification and regression issues.


```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Convert the outcome variable to a factor
cleaned_titanic$Survived <- factor(cleaned_titanic$Survived, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Not Survived", "Survived"))

# Define the train control
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Fit the classification model using rpart
tree_wp <- train(Survived ~ ., data = cleaned_titanic, trControl = train_control, method = "rpart")

tree_wp

```



```{r}
cleaned_titanic$Survived <- as.factor(cleaned_titanic$Survived)
 
#predict with test 
pred_tree <- predict(tree_wp, cleaned_titanic)
#generate confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix(cleaned_titanic$Survived, pred_tree)

```



```{r}
#visualize tree
fancyRpartPlot(tree_wp$finalModel, caption = "")

```
  
          THE DECISION TREE ABOVE RELIES ON THREE FEATURES Sex, Pclass and Fare.

Although there is no comparative difference in the confusion matrix between the first model and the current chosen one.

hypers = rpart.control(minsplit = 50, maxdepth = 3, minbucket = 50) 
tree3 <- train(Survived ~., data = cleaned_titanic, control = hypers, trControl = train_control, method = "rpart1SE") 
tree3


```

```{r}
# Training Set 
# Evaluate the fit with a confusion matrix

# Confusion Matrix 
cfm <- confusionMatrix(cleaned_titanic$Survived, pred_tree)
cfm

```

THE DECISION TREE ABOVE RELIES ON THREE MAIN FEATURES  Sex, Pclass and Embarked.

2.knn: 

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, sometimes referred to as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier that relies on closeness to produce classifications or predictions about the grouping of a single data point. 
Here we perform knn by applying Tunelength and Tunegrid, to see how the model performs, and which is better. 


```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Remember scaling is crucial for KNN
ctrl <- trainControl(method="cv", number = 10) 
knnFit <- train(Survived ~ ., data = cleaned_titanic, 
                method = "knn", 
                trControl = ctrl, 
                preProcess = c("center","scale"))

#Output of kNN fit
knnFit

```

```{r}
set.seed(123)
ctrl <- trainControl(method="cv", number = 10) 
knnFit <- train(Survived ~ ., data = cleaned_titanic, 
                method = "knn", 
                trControl = ctrl, 
                preProcess = c("center","scale"),
                tuneLength = 15)

# Show a plot of accuracy vs k 
plot(knnFit)

```

Distance Functions

```{r}
library(kknn)

# setup a tuneGrid with the tuning parameters
tuneGrid <- expand.grid(kmax = 3:7,                        # test a range of k values 3 to 7
                        kernel = c("rectangular", "cos"),  # regular and cosine-based distance functions
                        distance = 1:3)                    # powers of Minkowski 1 to 3

# tune and fit the model with 10-fold cross validation,
# standardization, and our specialized tune grid
kknn_fit <- train(Survived ~ ., 
                  data = cleaned_titanic,
                  method = 'kknn',
                  trControl = ctrl,
                  preProcess = c('center', 'scale'),
                  tuneGrid = tuneGrid)

# Printing trained model provides report
kknn_fit

```



Applying the Model:

```{r}
# Predict
pred_knn <- predict(kknn_fit, cleaned_titanic)

# Check levels of predicted values
levels(pred_knn)

# Check levels of actual values
levels(cleaned_titanic$Survived)

# Convert predicted values to factor with the same levels as actual values
pred_knn <- factor(pred_knn, levels = levels(cleaned_titanic$Survived))

# Generate confusion matrix
cfm <- confusionMatrix(cleaned_titanic$Survived, pred_knn)

```


Extracting the Results Table:

```{r}
knn_results = kknn_fit$results # gives just the table of results by parameter
head(knn_results)
```


```{r}
# group by k and distance function, create an aggregation by averaging
knn_results <- knn_results %>%
  group_by(kmax, kernel) %>%
  mutate(avgacc = mean(Accuracy))
head(knn_results)
```


```{r}
# plot aggregated (over Minkowski power) accuracy per k, split by distance function
ggplot(knn_results, aes(x=kmax, y=avgacc, color=kernel)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) + geom_line()

```


```{r}
#knn cluster 
rotated_data$Color <- pred_knn 
ggplot(data = rotated_data, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, col = Color )) + geom_point(alpha = 0.8) 

#The confusion matrix of the knn tunegrid model performed the best. With better accuracy in predicting.

I.REFLECTION:

The volume of data has grown significantly and continues to do so. In a similar way, data complexity is growing with time. A data scientist today uses many data types at once to forecast and make judgments. There is currently a need for methods, processes, or tools that will enable them to assess data more quickly and readily due to the complexity. 

To help data scientists make judgments, spot emerging trends, and provide fresh methods for predictive analysis, data science is the combination of advanced machine learning algorithms with a wide range of tools. 

The foundation of machine learning is the idea that by providing data and defining characteristics, you can teach and train machines. Computers learn, grow, adapt, and develop on their own when given recent, relevant data without the need for explicit programming. Without data, machine learning is a pretty small discipline. The Machine looks for patterns in the dataset, automatically recognizes patterns in behavior, and forecasts results. Lack of training data, inability to scale models, and data conflicts are a few machine learning restrictions that must be overcome.

Regression analysis, clustering, and classification, which are the three primary fundamental components from the previous study, help us get closer to developing models that will help humanity in many different disciplines by easing workloads and saving time.
